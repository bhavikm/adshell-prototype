    <h1>Franchises</h1>
	<h3>Proven System</h3>
    <p>Buying into a franchise is not just buying a successful brand name. You’re also investing into a system that’s been proven to be a profitable enterprise. This feature of franchising means that you start ahead of the competition in terms of optimising your workflow systems, developing a customer base and being able to predict how successful you should be. This is one of the reasons why franchises have a much lower failure rate than start-up small businesses.</p>
	
	<h3>The Right Stuff</h3>
    <p>Australia already leads the world in terms of franchises per capita. We’ve managed to grow past the US and it’s only New Zealand that comes close to us. The reasons for this have to do with the unique psychological make-up that Australians have, with a high degree of entrepreneurialism combined with a prudent level of risk averseness. Franchising is a business model that naturally appeals to this combination. </p>
	
	<h3>Changing Nature of Franchising</h3>
    <p>Franchising has been in existence since at least the 1850’s and its development over time is a testament to a business model that is resilient to all economic, social and political climates. Where previously there was one fixed model of franchisors selling franchises like inert property, now there’s models with no cash up front, business-within-business models and exciting new social enterprise franchises. In essence, you should choose franchising if you want to skip ahead of the painful system-building process of every new startup and get on with the job of building your own success.</p>
